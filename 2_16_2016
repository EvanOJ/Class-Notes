HTML & CSS

1. ATOM split screen

2. Emmet (package for html, download through atom)

each html page should have:

<html>
  <head></head>
  ??
  <body>
  </body>
  
</html>

IDs are for unique elements (should not have multiple of the same name)
Classes are for repeatable,identical elements
Elements ??

.school-item h1 {
  font-size:40px;
}

<div class ="school-item">
  <h1>henry charles, school</h1>
  </div>

outside ---> inside
  1.margin
  2.border
  3.padding
  4.content

inline positioning v. block positioning//

  buttons are inline elements (always, regardless of browser)
  links are inline elements generically as well
  spans too ?
  
  h1's are block elements ----. that is, even if there is room on the same line on the web page, it will push the
  content down to the next line
  
  by default every element is given a STATIC position
  
  if set to RELATIVE;
  item can then be moved (by using LEFT: some number, Right:some number) RELATIVE to where it would have gone if it were static
  
  if set to ABSOLUTE;
  no other element on the page cares about where that item is (can overlap, etc.)
  
  sometimes instead of using margin px or % can set WIDTH (then instead of it always changinng based on screen size, will remain that size)

  ^website to see which browser supports what font/style/etc. 
  
GRIDs 
  supposedly what to use for assingment2.whoops

JQUERY
  
  jQuery("") selects everything in the DOM
  DOM = "document object model"
  
  .toggle() adds something if it wasnt there and removes it if it was 
  
  $.("") grabs whatever 
  
  .click() = a "handler" AKA "callback function"
  
  EX
  
  $.('p').click(function() {$(something here).toggleClass('active')}) 
  
  grabs all paragraph elements and does something when you click them, in this case toggles a class on it
  
  input fields dont have text/numbers they have VALUES (val)
