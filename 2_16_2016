HTML & CSS

1. ATOM split screen

2. Emmet (package for html, download through atom)

each html page should have:

<html>
  <head></head>
  ??
  <body>
  </body>
  
</html>

IDs are for unique elements (should not have multiple of the same name)
Classes are for repeatable,identical elements
Elements ??

.school-item h1 {
  font-size:40px;
}

<div class ="school-item">
  <h1>henry charles, school</h1>
  </div>

outside ---> inside
  1.margin
  2.border
  3.padding
  4.content

inline positioning v. block positioning//

  buttons are inline elements (always, regardless of browser)
  links are inline elements generically as well
  spans too ?
  
  h1's are block elements ----. that is, even if there is room on the same line on the web page, it will push the
  content down to the next line
  
  by default every element is given a STATIC position
  
  if set to RELATIVE;
  item can then be moved (by using LEFT: some number, Right:some number) RELATIVE to where it would have gone if it were static
  
  if set to ABSOLUTE;
  no other element on the page cares about where that item is (can overlap, etc.)
