AJAX - AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging 
small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. 
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

asyncronous javascript and xml
======================================

understore _.each() 

_.each([1,2,3], function(x) {console.log(x)})
does something for each of the values in the array

_.map( [1,2,3],function(x) { return x +1})

var result = _.filter ( [1,2,3], function (x) { return x%2 ==0})

call result = [2] 
========================================

jQuery library (will be using only for AJAX)
syntax is
$. 

dataset file

var request = $.('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPLN690-MUSA610/datasets/master/json/philadelphia-solar-installations.json')

  returns 

Object {readyState: 4, responseText: "[
↵    {
↵        "X": -75.0342594751373,
↵       ….976711,
↵        "LONG_": -75.134239
↵    }
↵]
↵", status: 200, statusText: "OK"}

request.done(function(result) { console.log(JSON.parse(result)); })

  returns
[Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 
Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 
Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object,
Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object]
Object {readyState: 4, responseText: "[
↵    {
↵        "X": -75.0342594751373,
↵       ….976711,
↵        "LONG_": -75.134239
↵    }
↵]
↵", status: 200, statusText: "OK"}

The done function is so that it only runs function when the data has been downloaded but it would hold up the rest of the code from
running
>>Example webpage, shopping when you click something and things are added to the page without refreshing the entire page.
